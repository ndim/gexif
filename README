    =====

WHAT IT IS
==========

gexif is a GUI application which shows the EXIF tags contained in JPG
and TIFF files.


BUILDING
========

gexif requires libexif-gtk, and thus libexif and either gtk2 or gtk3.
Building from the source tar ball usually involves the commands:

  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

When building from source out of git, please run "autoreconf -i" first.


NOTE TO PACKAGERS
=================

If libexif-gtk (with gtk2) is available at build time, gexif will be
built as gexif-gtk2.

If libexif-gtk3 is available at build time, gexif will be built as
gexif-gtk3.

"make install" will install as ${bindir}/gexif the built gexif-gtk3
executable if it has been built, or the gexif-gtk2 executable
otherwise.
